My name is Shahriar Shahrabi. I am an Iranian technical artist and art director, based in Berlin. 

During the past few years in the game industry, I have shipped two hit indie titles. The first one was Superflight, a game about free falling in procedurally generated landscapes. The second one is Puzzling Places, a 3D VR jigsaw puzzle game where you put together beautiful hyper realistic models of real life locations around the globe. Puzzling Places was the best rated game on the Oculus Quest store for an entire year. 

In Superflight, as it was a team of three, I contributed to every part of the game. From the development (coding, game design, art) to self publishing (company management, marketing and PR). For Puzzling Places, a team of 7, I was the creative lead on the project (game design, art direction and production) and also did development (gameplay and graphic programming, technical art and mobile optimisations). 

Beside games, during my time in Realities io, I have worked together with companies like Meta, Audi and NASA, doing interactive experiences for advertisement, cultural heritage and consulting.

On the technical side, I love linear algebra and mathematics, shader programming and learning new disciplines. My main languages are C# and C++. I have made [my own game engine](https://github.com/IRCSS/ToyRenderer) in C++ before, wrote real time [fluid simulation purely in GPU](https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/gentle-introduction-to-fluid-simulation-for-programmers-and-technical-artists-7c0045c40bac) using compute shaders, and have written a gradient descent [AI algorithm which paints](https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/procedural-paintings-with-genetic-evolution-algorithm-6838a6e64703), all in compute shader. On both my [Github page](https://github.com/IRCSS) and [blog](https://medium.com/@shahriyarshahrabi) you will find many more well documented, open source algorithms, usually accompanied by a blog post. The blog posts are not just about technical details but also cover art direction topics. The posts are also a good example of my joy of learning as well as teaching what I learn to others. 

On the art side, I have done hundreds of paintings, and have created concepts, modeled, textured and animated many dioramas. You can see some of these projects on my [Artstation](https://ircss.artstation.com/) and [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/shahriyarshahrabi).

On the teaching side, beside the technical blog posts on my Medium, I have also spoken in conferences and universities before. An example of it publicly accessible is my linear algebra for tech art talk.   

Finishing on a personal note, I am passionate about cultural heritage, history and everything art related. I love reading, climbing mountains and comics. For any questions you can reach me on:
